C Library Boilerplate is a starting point for C/C++ library projects and includes a functionally minimal makefile, dependency management tooling config, directory structures, and unit testing infrastructure.

## Requirements

To best utilize this boilerplate please ensure you have installed the following
* Python3+
* Pip
* C/C++ toolchain
* GNU make

## Dependencies

Instead of managing dependencies as git submodules. A seperate python program
called [gitman](https://github.com/jacebrowning/gitman) which does an excellent
job managing, updating and even building dependencies. If you have a proper
python3 and pip environment setup then gitman will be installed automatically.
